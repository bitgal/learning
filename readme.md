🌍 Project: Political Stability & Governance Analysis
1. Extract (Get data from API)
Use the World Bank Open Data API.
Example dataset: Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) → includes:
Political Stability
Government Effectiveness
Control of Corruption
Rule of Law
Endpoint example (returns JSON):
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/DE/indicator/GE.EST?format=json
(This gives Germany’s “Government Effectiveness” scores over time.)
📦 Python libs to use:
import requests
import pandas as pd
2. Transform (Clean the data)
Normalize JSON into a Pandas DataFrame.
Clean columns: rename, drop empty, parse years.
Example transformation:
Keep only columns country, year, indicator, value.
Fill missing values with interpolation or drop.
3. Load (Store into database)
Use SQLite (lightweight) with SQLAlchemy.
Create a table governance_indicators.
Insert rows with cleaned data.
📦 Python libs to use:
import sqlite3
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
4. Analysis (Answer questions)
Using Pandas (or SQL queries):
Trend: How has Germany’s political stability changed from 2000–2022?
Comparison: Compare Germany, UK, US on “Government Effectiveness.”
Correlation: Does “Control of Corruption” correlate with GDP per capita?
📦 Python libs to use:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
5. (Optional) Visualization / API
Create charts (line plot of stability index over time).
Use FastAPI to expose an endpoint like /country-trend/DE returning JSON or a chart.
🛠️ Tools & Libraries Mapping
Extraction → requests, pandas
Transformation → pandas, numpy
Loading → sqlite3, SQLAlchemy
Analysis → pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Optional Serving → FastAPI
Optional Orchestration → Airflow or Prefect if you want to refresh data periodically
Example Analysis Ideas
Political Stability trends in Germany vs. France vs. UK (2000–2022).
Does higher Government Effectiveness correlate with lower Corruption?
Rank EU countries by average stability score in the last 10 years.
